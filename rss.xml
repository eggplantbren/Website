        <title>Some nice feedback on our latest cricket paper</title>
        <link>https://www.brendonbrewer.com/blog.html#cricket-feedback</link>
        <description>This afternoon I had my weekly meeting with PhD student
                Ollie
                Stevenson. It was a routine meeting where he showed me
                what he'd been working on and we discussed a few issues
                around it. Then he mentioned that our most recently submitted
                paper had received some feedback. It was pretty good feedback!

                Thanks, Nick! This was super pleasing to read.
                I just hope the journal referees feel the same way, or at least
                half as positively. But until
                we hear back from them you can get the preprint
                from the arxiv
                or (why not) from LBRY.</description>

        <title>Rocking Lookup Tables in 2019</title>
        <link>https://www.brendonbrewer.com/blog.html#lookup-tables</link>
        <description>Do people learn about lookup tables anymore? I don't know where
                I picked them up from, but I have the impression that they are
                an old-fashioned programming technique from the 1980s and 1990s.
                However, I find myself using them all the time even though it's 2019.</description>

        <description>This morning I bought a muffin from the convenience store on
                campus. In front of the muffins there is a sign instructing us
                to use the tongs to pick up a muffin, instead of our possibly
                grotty hands...</description>

        <description>Attentive readers and/or stalkers may have noticed a recent
                addition on the research page of this site: a paper accepted
                for publication in Nature. This was an interesting collaboration
                with my PhD supervisor Geraint Lewis, whom I visited last year...</description>

        <description>I sometimes tell my graduate students that the most important
                section of their dissertation is the acknowledgements. This
                is because it will be
                read by far more people than the rest, by a wide margin.
                After the acknowledgements, the next most important part
                is to put in some interesting or fun quotes at the beginning
                of the chapters...</description>

        <description>A month or two ago, Lianne and I bought a Yamaha MT-03 to help with commuting. It's
                been really fun riding again, though of course I have plenty
                of reasons for caution on the roads. Today I experienced a
                hazard I've never encountered before...</description>

        <description>As my loyal reader knows, I've been into LBRY for a while now after hearing
                about it from economist Alex Tabarrok. It still has a ways to go to be fully featured
                and get more adoption, but it's been a fun thing to learn about
                and play with. Today I wanted to tell you about a cool feature that isn't supported
                in the GUI app yet but can be done from the command line...</description>

        <description>When I lived in Australia, I never really paid much
            attention to the popular pop/rock singers that Australia had
            produced. I think I thought of them (Jimmy Barnes, John Farnham

        <description>A quote from statistician John Tukey that is a clich√© for a
                reason
                is "the best thing about being a statistician is that you get
                to
                play in everyone's backyard". Sometimes, other people invite
                you
                to their backyards,
                like
                geophysicist Mike Rowe did. Other times, you just invite

        <link>https://www.brendonbrewer.com/blog.html#using-220-skills</link>
        <description>One of the best and worst things about being an academic is
                that sometimes you are assigned to teach a course about
                something you aren't very good at, or in some cases, have
                never learned at all. As long as you can keep ahead of the
                students, it usually works out fine. I've been lucky so far
                that this hasn't happened much, and when it has, I've been
                grateful to have learned the new material...</description>

        <title>MaxEnt and homogeneity</title>
        <link>https://www.brendonbrewer.com/blog.html#maxent-and-homogeneity</link>
        <description>I'm a bit unusual among Bayesians in that I still think the principle of maximum entropy
                is both true and (occasionally) useful, and that its critics have thrown out the
                baby with the bathwater. One of the chapters of my upcoming book,
                if I finish it, will be about this issue, and related ones such as where
                MaxEnt constraints come from in the first place...</description>

        <link>https://www.brendonbrewer.com/blog.html#conventions-wide-priors</link>
        <description>I'm currently preparing to teach STATS 731, the graduate
                Bayesian course here.
                My first lecture was meant to be today but
                I had to cancel it due to hoarseness following a throat
                infection. Anyway, the existing course materials use a lot
                of the traditional (in statistics) wide priors, stuff like this
                for a location and scale parameter respectively...</description>

        <description>I recently enjoyed
                this excellent talk
                by Dallas Willard, entitled The Nature and
                Necessity of Worldviews. If you're familiar with
                Jonathan Haidt's work, it strikes familiar notes,
                but Willard's personal angle as a frustrated
                Christian in the secular university comes through...</description>

        <description>The other day I bought a domain name for my website, which
                was fun, and has motivated me to continue simplifying
                my internet
                life in a few ways. Over the last year or so I've successfully
                reduced my social media usage by about 80%, and am now using
                the internet like it's 1999 again...</description>
