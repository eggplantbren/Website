            Hello everyone, and Happy Easter!

            Over the years, I've sometimes had to teach courses that weren't originally in my wheelhouse. Luckily, I've had good heads of department who haven't made me teach things I don't believe in. Sometimes, there's a little bit of that, but I can easily work around it with a sermon...

        <title>My Previous Blog Post is Fake News</title>
        <link>https://www.brendonbrewer.com/blog2019.html#fake-news</link>
        <description>
            A few days ago I found out that my previous blog post about how
            I fixed my laggy laptop was all
            wrong. Well, maybe those things did help a
            little bit. However, the thing that *finally* solved the problem
            once and for all (yes, that's actually true this time)
            was switching to a real-time kernel.
            My laptop is amazing again now. That shouldn't have been
            necessary, but I'm just glad it's fixed!

        <title>Weirdest Computer Fix Ever</title>
        <link>https://www.brendonbrewer.com/blog2019.html#weirdest-fix-ever</link>
        <description>
                My laptop is pretty decent given that it only cost $1000 NZD,
                but I've had an annoying mouse lag issue lately. I suspected
                just about every program I run of causing this (for example,
                Brave, Discord, and LBRY often showed high up on my top
                output, but I couldn't really single one of these out in a
                satisfying way. So I did what I probably should have done at
                the beginning, and searched for my issue.

                I searched for lagging mouse and found a post about a wireless
                mouse, which matched my situation. The poster had fixed this
                issue by plugging the little dongle receiver in via a hub or
                USB extension cord instead of straight into the computer.
                I tried this today, and it worked!

                It's a pretty weird fix, but I'll take it. Now the mouse only
                lags if the hard disk is getting thrashed, which is what I'd
                expect to happen anyway.

        <title>Three Views of Bayesian Inference</title>
        <link>https://www.brendonbrewer.com/blog2019.html#three-views-inference</link>
        <description>
                In this post I will describe three two ways of looking at any given
                Bayesian inference problem. The three ways are all mutually
                compatible, but bring out different aspects of what is going on.
                This is a very condensed version of what will ultimately be several
                book chapters.

                Sorry MH, cutting short here because the post depends on fancy HTML
                which won't render well here and will make my RSS file invalid ;-)

        <link>https://www.brendonbrewer.com/blog2019.html#sub-to-newsletter</link>
        <description>I've started a newsletter and will be sending out the first
                issue soon. The intended frequency is once per fortnight but
                I might change that in the future depending on how things go.
                The newsletter will cover any topics of interest to me (and hopefully
                you). Please sign up
                <a href="https://brendonbrewer.com/#newsletter" target="_blank">here</a>
                if you're interested. When you do this, you'll be sent a confirmation
                email to click on. Please check your spam folder just in case!

                I am considering archiving the newsletters
                somewhere as well but I'm not 100% sure yet.</description>

        <title>Some nice feedback on our latest cricket paper</title>
        <link>https://www.brendonbrewer.com/blog2019.html#cricket-feedback</link>
        <description>This afternoon I had my weekly meeting with PhD student
                Ollie
                Stevenson. It was a routine meeting where he showed me
                what he'd been working on and we discussed a few issues
                around it. Then he mentioned that our most recently submitted
                paper had received some feedback. It was pretty good feedback!
                Check this out: [IMAGE]

                Thanks, Nick! This was super pleasing to read.
                I just hope the journal referees feel the same way, or at least
                half as positively. But until
                we hear back from them you can get the preprint
                from the arxiv
                or (why not) from LBRY.</description>

        <title>Rocking Lookup Tables in 2019</title>
        <link>https://www.brendonbrewer.com/blog2019.html#lookup-tables</link>
        <description>Do people learn about lookup tables anymore? I don't know where
                I picked them up from, but I have the impression that they are
                an old-fashioned programming technique from the 1980s and 1990s.
                However, I find myself using them all the time even though it's 2019.</description>

                is because it will be
                read by far more people than the rest, by a wide margin.
                After the acknowledgements, the next most important part
                is to put in some interesting or fun quotes at the beginning

        <description>As my loyal reader knows, I've been into LBRY for a while now after hearing
                about it from economist Alex Tabarrok. It still has a ways to go to be fully featured
                and get more adoption, but it's been a fun thing to learn about
                and play with. Today I wanted to tell you about a cool feature that isn't supported
                in the GUI app yet but can be done from the command line...</description>

        <description>A quote from statistician John Tukey that is a cliché for a
                reason
                is "the best thing about being a statistician is that you get
                to
                play in everyone's backyard". Sometimes, other people invite
                you
                to their backyards,
                like
                geophysicist Mike Rowe did. Other times, you just invite

        <link>https://www.brendonbrewer.com/blog2019.html#using-220-skills</link>
        <description>One of the best and worst things about being an academic is
                that sometimes you are assigned to teach a course about
                something you aren't very good at, or in some cases, have
                never learned at all. As long as you can keep ahead of the
                students, it usually works out fine. I've been lucky so far
                that this hasn't happened much, and when it has, I've been
                grateful to have learned the new material...</description>

        <description>I'm a bit unusual among Bayesians in that I still think the principle of maximum entropy
                is both true and (occasionally) useful, and that its critics have thrown out the
                baby with the bathwater. One of the chapters of my upcoming book,
                if I finish it, will be about this issue, and related ones such as where
                MaxEnt constraints come from in the first place...</description>

        <description>I'm currently preparing to teach STATS 731, the graduate

                My first lecture was meant to be today but
                I had to cancel it due to hoarseness following a throat
                infection. Anyway, the existing course materials use a lot
