            <p>
                This afternoon I had my weekly meeting with PhD student
                <a href="http://www.oliverstevenson.co.nz/" target="new">Ollie
                Stevenson</a>. It was a routine meeting where he showed me
                what he'd been working on and we discussed a few issues
                around it. Then he mentioned that our most recently submitted
                paper had received some feedback. It was pretty good feedback!
                Check this out:

                Thanks, Nick! This was super pleasing to read.
                I just hope the journal referees feel the same way, or at least
                half as positively. But until
                we hear back from them you can get the preprint
                from the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11490" target="_blank">arxiv</a>
                or (why not) from

            <p>2019-08-20</p>

            <p>
                Do people learn about lookup tables anymore? I don't know where
                I picked them up from, but I have the impression that they are
                an old-fashioned programming technique from the 1980s and 1990s.
                However, I find myself using them all the time even though it's 2019.
                I have no idea whether they're a good idea in languages like
                Python or R, but I use them a lot in C++ and I should try them
                in Haskell some time.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, in some work I'm doing at the moment, I am fitting
                profiles to spectra of singers singing a single note. The spectra contain many
                peaks, and some of the peaks look approximately Gaussian whereas
                others look more like a Cauchy distribution. To capture these
                different shapes, I'm using model functions that are proportional
                to the density function of a Student <em>t</em>-distribution.
                For a peak of amplitude 1 centered at position 0
                with unit width and shape parameter \(\nu\), the functional
                form is
            </p>

            <p>
                $$f(x) = \left(1 + \frac{x^2}{\nu}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}(\nu + 1)}.$$
            </p>

            <p>
                The profile can be moved around using a location, scale, and
                amplitude parameter.
                Since I have to evaluate fifty of these (there are lots of peaks)
                per MCMC iteration in my fit, it dominates the computational
                cost. Things are much faster if I make a grid of \(x\)-values,
                populated with evaluations of \(f(x)\) at the grid points.
                I also have several arrays to cover a range of values of
                \(\nu\). This happens once at the beginning of my run, and
                if I want to evaluate \(f(x)\) for the billionth time,
                I just figure out which
                element of my pre-computed arrays is closest to the input
                \(x\)-value and get the
                corresponding \(f(x)\) value out
                (actually I linearly interpolate from the two
                grid points that my \(x\) falls between).
            </p>

            <p>
                Here's the result of one of my fits. You can really see the
                need for the \(t\)-like shape in the second harmonic.
                The red curve comes from a continuum component I used which
                had a very flexible prior, and the blue is the total model
                curve after adding all the \(t\)-shaped harmonic peaks.

            <p>2019-08-12</p>

            <p>
                This morning I bought a muffin from the convenience store on
                campus. In front of the muffins there is a sign instructing us
                to use the tongs to pick up a muffin, instead of our possibly
                grotty hands. I didn't, though &mdash; I just grabbed a muffin
                with my hands, disobeying the sign. Why would the tongs be
                clean to touch? They're telling everyone to touch them!
            </p>

            <p>
                Presumably someone could touch a muffin and then change their
                mind and put it back, contaminated. The tongs would prevent
                this, but then the same person would have touched the tongs.
                I could be way off here, but is the whole tong ritual just
                "hygiene theatre", similar to how many regard airport security
                as "security theatre"? I don't know for sure, but I'm going to
                continue not using the tongs.

                  name="two-songs">Two singers and songs I've been enjoying</a>
            <p>2019-08-08</p>
                
            <p>
                On my old blog I occasionally posted songs that I'm into, for
                no particular reason other than wanting to share them. I don't
                know if anyone listened or liked those, but I thought I'd just
                continue to do it anyway. So here are two of my recent favourites.
                First, Universal Sound, by country singer-songwriter Tyler
                Childers. I adore this song both technically and emotionally.
            </p>

            <p class="center">

            </p>

            <p>
                Second, Australian virtuoso singer Vanessa Amorosi (of Sydney Olympics/noughties
                pop fame) covering Aretha Franklin and doing a
                wonderful job of it. The guitarist with the funny hat is the guy
                from Eurythmics. Also, in case you're curious about
                Complete Vocal Technique lingo, most of what Amorosi is famous
                for is using the edge mode higher in the range than most
                singers do. One of the commenters called it an "upper chest belt"
                which I suppose is the normal terminology for what she does when
                everyone gets really impressed (or calls it screeching, as my
                Nan would :)). Much of the earlier part of the song is in neutral.
            </p>

            <p>2019-07-22</p>

            <p>
                Attentive readers and/or stalkers may have noticed a recent
                addition on the research page of this site: a paper accepted
                for publication in Nature. This was an interesting collaboration
                with my PhD supervisor Geraint Lewis, whom I visited last year.
                We intended to work on two other projects but those didn't work
                out. Instead, I ended up doing the Bayesian
                model comparison for the hypothesis that there
                are two rotational components in M31's
                globular cluster population (distinguished by whether or not
                the globalar cluster is associated with substructure or not)
                vs. the hypothesis of
                a single rotational component.
                It was a reasonably straightforward inference problem from
                my point of view, but with cool astronomical implications.
            </p>

            <p>
                From a statistical point of view, it was a nice opportunity
                to try applying John Skilling's advice to future-proof results
                by presenting the marginal likelihood, so that future analyses
                can be trivially compared to ours without having to re-do ours.
                In addition to calculating the marginal likelihoods of six
                different models, I also calculated the marginal likelihood of
                the "top statement" \(\top\) of the whole paper, i.e.,
                the logical disjunction of the six models, or the proposition
                that <em>one of these six models is correct</em>. I hope to
                make this a habit in future publications.
            </p>

            <p>
                Getting a Nature paper is also a pretty nice thing
                from a career point of view. Journals are a bit of an
                anachronism and there are lots of well-worn complaints about
                them, but they still function as a way of measuring the
                status of a paper or a researcher with minimal time and
                other transaction
                costs. With Nature, you can also assess the results quickly
                using the joke that anything published there is eventually
                found to be incorrect.
                I'm looking forward to someone figuring out a way
                to replace journals (surely it is possible with the internet
                and blockchains and such), but until then, this is satisfying to
                have. Once the preprint is up I'll link to it. If you want
                to check out my inference code for the project, it is available

                It's been pretty quiet here since I've been busy again. Here

                In the last couple of months I've come across some pretty
                cool new programs that I thought I'd tell you all about
                (I know I have at least one reader &mdash; I got a really
                nice email from a former student who reads the blog).
            </p>

            <p>
                First, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/zstd/" target="_blank">Zstandard</a>.
                It's a new-ish compression algorithm that was
                developed by a guy at Facebook. It seems to have really good
                properties, compressing both quickly and effectively &mdash;
                way faster than bzip2 and with better compression than gzip.
                I think you can use it with
                tar but I haven't figured out how yet. You can always do it in
                two steps though:
            </p>

            <pre>tar cvf myfile.tar mydir
zstd myfile.tar -o myfile.tar.zst</pre>
            <br>

            <p>
                The command to unzip is a bit awkward: <span class="mono">unzstd</span>.
                But the performance is so impressive I'm willing to overlook that!
            </p>

            <p>
                The other thing I had to do recently was delete a Bitcoin wallet
                from an old computer before getting rid of it. To do so, I
                used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srm_(Unix)" target="_blank">srm</a>
                (secure <span class="mono">rm</span>), which does a bunch of fancy wiping to
                make sure it can't be read even by someone hardcore. It's
                very easy to use &mdash; you can just <span class="mono">srm</span> a file like you would
                <span class="mono">rm</span> one, and it uses sane and intense defaults to make sure
                it's not recoverable.

            <p>
                I sometimes tell my graduate students that the most important
                section of their dissertation is the acknowledgements. This
                is because it will be
                read by far more people than the rest, by a wide margin.
                After the acknowledgements, the next most important part
                is to put in some interesting or fun quotes at the beginning
                of the chapters.

                I thought I'd share a couple of the quotes here. There will be more!
            </p>

            <p>James Clerk Maxwell:
                <em>
                The actual science of logic is conversant at present only with things either certain, impossible, or
                entirely doubtful, none of which (fortunately) we have to reason on. Therefore the true logic for this
                world is the calculus of Probabilities, which takes account of the magnitude of the probability which
                is, or ought to be, in a reasonable man’s mind.</em>
            </p>

            <p>Kevin H. Knuth and John Skilling:
            <em>The set-based view is ontological in character and associated with Kolmogorov, while the logic-based
view is epistemological in character and associated with Cox.</em>

            <p>A colleague who may or may not remain unnamed: <em>Jaynes has too much MaxEnt shit in it</em>
                [BJB: I disagree with the colleague's dismissal of the subject].</p>

            <p>C. S. Lewis: <em>I doubt whether we are sufficiently attentive to the importance of elementary text books.</em></p>

            <p>John Skilling: <em>I think that the fundamentals of Bayesian analysis should be very simple and accessible to school
                children.</em></p>

            <p>Ariel Caticha: <em>Before the data information is available, not only we do not know \(\theta\), we do not know \(D\) either.</em></p>

            <p>Newman: <em>But you remember this. When you control the mail, you control <b>information</b>.</em></p>

            <p>I use that last one on my Dad a lot (he's a postman), but it
                also works for the information theory chapter. I hope you
                enjoyed these!</p>

            <p>
                A month or two ago, Lianne and I bought a Yamaha MT-03 to help with commuting. It's
                been really fun riding again, though of course I have plenty
                of reasons for caution on the roads. Today I experienced a
                hazard I've never encountered before, though &mdash; hail.
            </p>

            <p>
                I had taken the bike to the North Shore for its first service.
                It was clear weather when I left to head home, though the
                CBD seemed to be covered in a dark cloud of doom as I
                approached the harbour bridge. I didn't even get to the bridge
                before I got hailed on, though. Luckily the hail was quite
                small and didn't do any damage to me or the bike.
            </p>

            <p>
                Funnily enough I think this was only the second worst riding
                weather I've ever had. Back in Sydney around 2008 or so I
                once had to pull over under an underpass on the M4 because I
                was afraid of being struck by lightning. I stopped for about
                half an hour before the lightning cleared up.
            </p>

            <p>
                By the time I arrived home today, in true Auckland form, it was sunny
                for about 10 minutes. Then it rained heavily. The one upside
                is that this city knows how to make good rainbows (click
                for high resolution):

            <p>2019-06-01</p>

            <p>
                As my loyal reader knows, I've been into LBRY for a while now after hearing
                about it from economist Alex Tabarrok. It still has a ways to go to be fully featured
                and get more adoption, but it's been a fun thing to learn about
                and play with. Today I wanted to tell you about a cool feature that isn't supported
                in the GUI app yet but can be done from the command line.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the fun things you can do in the app is send a tip to someone after (or before :))
                watching or downloading their video or other file. Rather than going straight to the
                publisher's wallet, the tip gets associated with the
                item, which has a few benefits. First, the item will rank higher in search results,
                and secondly, it means that the publisher's claim to the short URL of the item
                (such as <span class="mono">lbry://hello</span>, as opposed to a full permanent URL such as
                <span class="mono">lbry://hello#b981513aeb8ff0394cc2d1d4aef6c1fa5177e24a</span>)
                gets stronger, in the sense
                that someone would need to spend more in order to take over the short URL.
                If the publisher does want to
                spend the tip, it needs to be "unlocked" from the item and transferred into
                the publisher's wallet.
            </p>

            <p>
                Tips work fine in the GUI app already, but there's something even more cool that
                you can do only from the command line at present. You can use some of your
                credits to support someone else's channel or item <i>without sending them a tip</i>,
                and in a way that can be easily reversed if you actually want to spend the LBC
                or use it elsewhere.
                A tip is a special case of something which is more generally called a "support" &mdash;
                specifically, a tip is a support where you lose the LBC you tip and the publisher gains it.
                The other kind of
                support lets you put some of your LBC towards someone else's publication, but you
                retain the right to withdraw it at any time, rather than giving that right
                to the publisher.
            </p>

            <p>
                To make one of these, first you need the unique identifier of the claim
                (channel or published file), called the <span class="mono">claim_id</span>.
                If you know the full
                URL already, the <span class="mono">claim_id</span>
                is just the part after the <span class="mono">#</span>. If you only
                know the short URL, you can go to the command line and type something
                like this
            </p>
            <pre>lbrynet resolve lbry://hello</pre><br>

            <p>
                and then look for the <span class="mono">claim_id</span> in the output. If the item is
                inside a channel, you'll get the channel's <span class="mono">claim_id</span> in the
                output too, so make sure you can tell which is which.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once you know the <span class="mono">claim_id</span>, it's pretty easy to make a non-tip
                support. Here's how I would do it for the hello example once
                I knew the <span class="mono">claim_id</span>:
            </p>
            <pre>lbrynet support create --claim_id=b981513aeb8ff0394cc2d1d4aef6c1fa5177e24a --amount=10.0</pre><br>

            <p>
                If you wanted to create the support as a tip instead (like you
                can do in the app), just pass an extra <span class="mono">--tip</span> option to the
                command.
            </p>
            <pre>lbrynet support create --tip --claim_id=b981513aeb8ff0394cc2d1d4aef6c1fa5177e24a --amount=10.0</pre><br>

            <p>
                Obviously the amount can be changed depending on how much you
                want to use. If you decide to abandon the support (i.e., withdraw
                the LBC back to yourself), you don't need to use the command line &mdash;
                the transaction appears in the app with a little trash icon next
                to it which you can use to abandon the support:
            </p>

            <p>
            <img src="images/abandon-support.png" alt="Trash icon for abandoning support">
            </p>

            <p>
                Now that I know about this, there's little reason not to
                deposit most of my credits against stuff I like! Better to have
                them sitting there doing something cool as opposed to just
                sitting there!

                The initial flurry of posts here may have implied that I would
                be keeping up that rate long term. I can't promise that, but I
                will try to post regularly still. Things have been pretty busy
                with teaching STATS 731 for the first time (I always find it
                hard to teach a course for the first time), and with Mackenzie
                picking up viruses from daycare on a regular basis.
            </p>

            <p>
                One thing I've done to 731 is to put in Nested Sampling and
                more on model comparison. I've been emphasising it a lot.
                If you're interested in that, you might enjoy

            <p>2019-05-16</p>

            <p>
                When I lived in Australia, I never really paid much attention to
                the popular pop/rock singers that Australia had produced.
                I think I
                thought of them (Jimmy Barnes, John Farnham et al)
                as cheesy. But after
                living in the USA for three years I became really nostalgic
                for them, and this was boosted when I realised they were
                excellent singers. They also fit into the eras of music
                where most of my favourites are from &mdash; commonly known
                as "dad music". I don't know why, but
                I've always been a few decades
                behind, except for when I liked some 90s artists in the
                late 90s.
            </p>

            <p>
                My latest "discovery" along the same lines, who I've known about
                my whole life, is Iva Davies and Icehouse. I've been digging
                the album <a href="https://www.allmusic.com/album/man-of-colours-mw0000197386"
                target="_blank">Man of Colours</a>. It sounds a lot like 80s-era
                David Bowie (think "Let's Dance"), and I think they actually
                toured together around that time:

                 alt="Bowie and Davies" width="40%">
            </p>

            <p>
                Davies's vocals are often in the tenor range which I always find
                exciting and challenging, and he provides more evidence that mullets
                assist with this. Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMQwRL0EzW0" target="_blank">"Crazy"</a>,
                which shows off the mullet and the harbour bridge. Iconic!

            <p>
                Answer: 36. That's 36 people who don't understand the LBRY
                naming/URL system, which works using <a href="https://lbry.com/faq/naming" target="_blank">a form of auction that
                provides no incentive to squatting.</a> [edit: found the
                easier explanation].
                That's also 36 people who are going to be disappointed
                if LBRY becomes popular and then find out their reward
                for early-adopting and calling their channel @PewDiePie is
                basically nothing.

            <p>
                For technical people, the command I ran to get that

                There'll be an upgrade soon where the relevant command will

            <p>
                A quote from statistician John Tukey that is a cliché for a
                reason
                is <i>the best thing about being a statistician is that you get
                to
                play in everyone's backyard</i>. Sometimes, other people invite
                you
                to their backyards,
                <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04556" target="_blank">like
                geophysicist Mike Rowe did</a>. Other times, you just invite
                yourself
                over.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <a href="http://completevocal.institute" target="_blank">Complete
                Vocal Institute</a> was founded by
                Cathrine Sadolin, who struggled to learn to sing
                until she reinvented the field in a way
                that made sense for herself. Singing teaching has historically
                been a lot more of an art than a science, and her approach is a lot
                more methodical than most. There are things you could critique
                about it of course, but when I discovered it years ago it grabbed
                my attention because it was the first time I'd seen someone
                actually write down an explicit model for the things voices can do
                and how to do each of those things. While the new me™️ is not
                a rationalist, singing instruction needed more of that on the margin.
                Actually connecting the model to practice was hard for me and it took
                a long time, and the model has been revised over the years anyway
                as they have been researching things and modifying it accordingly.
            </p>

            <p>
                Speaking of research, I just emailed them a few weeks ago to register
                myself as a fan of their work and a potential collaborator if they
                need statistics, which it turns out they do! So I'm now looking
                for a graduate student who's interested in vocals to work with me on
                that. They have lots of data and there are still forms to sign, but
                there should be lots of possibilities here! To be honest, there's some
                chance it won't work out, but I am excited so felt the need to
                write this and tell y'all about it.

                One of the best and worst things about being an academic is
                that sometimes you are assigned to teach a course about
                something you aren't very good at, or in some cases, have
                never learned at all. As long as you can keep ahead of the
                students, it usually works out fine. I've been lucky so far
                that this hasn't happened much, and when it has, I've been
                grateful to have learned the new material.

                an introductory computing course for statistics students,
                which teaches a bit of HTML, file formats, XML, SQL, and R.
                The course is the brainchild of <a href="https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul" target="_blank">Paul
                Murrell</a>, but our previous
                head of department wanted someone else to teach it so that more
                than one person knows the course. I was happy to
                do it since I like computing, and saying yes meant I was less
                likely to ever have to teach frequentism.
                When I started I knew a bit of HTML and R, and knew about
                file formats, but had never touched XML or SQL. At first I
                learned enough in order to teach the course, but not much more.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, recently I've had occasion to actually use more of
                this stuff in actual projects. For instance, this blog is written
                in plain HTML, and STATS 220's little HTML/CSS section has
                helped a fair bit so that I understand what I'm looking at when
                I use HTML. Today I set up an RSS feed (see that little button at
                the top of this page), which is secretly just an XML file, which
                I hand-wrote based on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/XML/xml_rss.asp"
                target="_blank">this guide from W3Schools</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've also recently enjoyed using SQL to query the LBRY
                blockchain and plot things such as the <a href="https://open.lbry.com/cryptocandor-tip-history"
                target="_blank">amount various creators have received in tips</a>
                and the <a href="https://spee.ch/@BrendonBrewer:3/claims.svg" target="_blank">total
                number of publications over time</a>. Those were done using
                simple SELECT commands as taught in STATS 220 &mdash; the
                only slightly fancy stuff being (i) an INNER JOIN of a table
                with itself, and (ii) figuring out how to submit the darned
                query to their MySQL server and handle the results that come back.
            </p>

            <p>
                See, students, some of this stuff <i>is</i> useful!

            <a class="blog_title" href="#maxent-and-homogeneity" name="maxent-and-homogeneity">MaxEnt and homogeneity</a>
            <p>2019-05-05</p>

            <p>
                I'm a bit unusual among Bayesians in that I still think the principle of maximum entropy
                is both true and (occasionally) useful, and that its critics have thrown out the
                baby with the bathwater. One of the chapters of my upcoming book,
                if I finish it, will be about this issue, and related ones such as where
                MaxEnt constraints come from in the first place.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some of the bad criticisms of MaxEnt focus on the fact that you can easily get
                poor predictions from a MaxEnt distribution,
                in an ex-post sense (i.e., a scoring rule could give
                the MaxEnt distribution a worse score than some other distribution that
                people might intuitively suggest). I don't know
                why this would surprise anybody. Any broad prior, especially on a
                high dimensional space,
                is usually bad in this sense. MaxEnt does <i>minimal updating</i>
                of probability distributions, and if you minimally update something
                that doesn't perform that well according to an ex-post criterion,
                you're likely to get something else that doesn't
                perform that well with respect to the same criterion.
            </p>

            <p>
                One interesting feature of MaxEnt distributions is that they often lead to
                macroscopically homogenous predictions. For example, let \(\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N\)
                be a batsman's
                next \(N\) scores in cricket, so the set of possibilities is
                \(S = \{0, 1, 2, 3, ...\}^N\). Starting with a flat prior over \(S\) and then
                doing MaxEnt with an expected value constraint like
            </p>

            <p>
                $$\left<\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N x_i\right> = \mu,$$
            </p>

            <p>
                gives a posterior distribution for the \(\{x_i\}\)
                which is a product of iid geometrics with means
                \(\mu\). If \(N\) is large, this implies a high posterior probability for the
                sequence of scores looking macroscopically homogeneous, because the
                constraint never put in any time-dependent information, and because
                <i>almost every element of \(S\) looks macroscopically homogenous</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, the actual sequence of scores \(\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N\)
                may have a trend or whatever. That doesn't mean MaxEnt is invalid!
                It still correctly updates the flat prior over \(S\) in a minimal
                fashion, which is what it claims to do.
                Most possible sequences (elements of \(S\))
                look macroscopically flat, so MaxEnt predicts that.
                Reality, being complicated,
                happened to produce a sequence that was atypical in that
                sense, but probably fairly typical in some other senses.

                This kind of thing makes my day:
            </p>

            <p style="font-style: italic">
                Dear Prof. Brewer, <br><br>
                I work as a Data Science/ML professional in the US having done my grad study in Stats.<br>
                I came across your Bayesian Stats course you teach at University of Auckland. I must
                say I have never found such a cogent and coherent text on Bayesian
                Statistics ever.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now I'm in a good mood. In related news, I've moved the
                notes <a href="https://www.brendonbrewer.com/stats331" target="_blank">here</a>
                for online reading.

                for wide priors in JAGS/BUGS</a>
            <p>2019-04-30</p>
            <p>
                I'm currently preparing to teach STATS 731, the graduate
                Bayesian course here.
                My first lecture was meant to be today but
                I had to cancel it due to hoarseness following a throat
                infection. Anyway, the existing course materials use a lot
                of the traditional (in statistics) wide priors, stuff like this
                for a location and scale parameter respectively:

            </p>

                <pre>beta ~ dnorm(0, 1.0E-4)</pre>
                <pre>tau ~ dgamma(0.001, 0.001)</pre>
                <pre>var <- 1/tau</pre>
                <pre>sig <- sqrt(var)</pre>

            <br>

            <p>
                In the 1990s, it was important to choose conjugate priors
                to speed up the MCMC sampling, and in many cases (e.g.
                regression) stuff like this was appropriate. It still works
                today, too. However, in my experience students find the choice
                of a prior a bit mysterious, and these are more obscure than
                they need to be. Who has an intuition for what that gamma
                prior looks like &mdash; even for tau, let alone sig (the
                coordinate that's usually more interpretable). Also, are we
                really so sure beta is between -200 and 200? Probably depends
                on the units of the problem.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my lecture on Thursday I'm still going to use these priors
                but I'm also going to (a) plot them, and (b) compare them
                to uniform and log-uniform priors which they are fairly similar
                to over a decent range of their parameter spaces. Hopefully this
                will remove a bit of the shroud of mystery.

                   target="_blank">this excellent talk</a>

                Regardless of what you think about issues of religion
                (I'm undecided myself), 90% of the talk can be filed under
                <i>important things I didn't learn until my 30s</i>, and can
                be applied to a great deal of other issues.

                out maths here</a>

            <p>
                When I moved my blog over here, I was a bit worried that I
                wouldn't be able
                to type \(\LaTeX\) anymore. But that's not the case! Thanks to
                <a href="https://mathjax.org"
                   target="_blank">MathJax</a>, I can now get equations
                in here
                very simply. Here are two of my favourites:
            </p>
            <p>
                $$P(H \,|\, D, M) = \frac{P(H \,|\, M)P(D \,|\, H, M)}
                                         {P(D \,|\, M)}$$
            </p>
            <p>
                $$H\left(\boldsymbol{p}; \boldsymbol{q}\right)
                    = -\sum_i p_i \log (p_i/q_i)$$
            </p>

            <p>
                While researching this, I also came across some PDF to HTML
                converters. That sounds like a horrible idea, but some worked
                a lot better than I thought. If you click on my CV at the
                top right you'll get what looks like a PDF document but is
                actually HTML! How cool.

                The other day I bought a domain name for my website, which
                was fun, and has motivated me to continue simplifying
                my internet
                life in a few ways. Over the last year or so I've successfully
                reduced my social media usage by about 80%, and am now using
                the internet like it's 1999 again (well, except for the

                <a href="https://keybase.io/">stuff</a>).
                It's been a pleasant experience, despite sounding

                In addition, Wordpress has been annoying
                lately with too many promotional emails and generally being
                more complicated than I need.
                Therefore, I've decided that I'll no longer be posting
                at plausibilitytheory.wordpress.com. I'll leave it up so
                people can still read it if they want, but in general, any
                new posts will go straight to the blog page on
                brendonbrewer.com.
