            <p>2019-06-01</p>

            <p>
                As my loyal reader knows, I've been into LBRY for a while now after hearing
                about it from economist Alex Tabarrok. It still has a ways to go to be fully featured
                and get more adoption, but it's been a fun thing to learn about
                and play with. Today I wanted to tell you about a cool feature that isn't supported
                in the GUI app yet but can be done from the command line.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the fun things you can do in the app is send a tip to someone after (or before :))
                watching or downloading their video or other file. The tip gets associated with the
                item, which has a few benefits. First, the item will rank higher in search results,
                and secondly, it means that the publisher's claim to the short URL of the item
                (such as lbry://hello, as opposed to a full permanent URL such as
                lbry://hello#b981513aeb8ff0394cc2d1d4aef6c1fa5177e24a) gets stronger, in the sense
                that someone would need to spend more in order to take over the short URL.
                If the publisher wants
                to spend the tip, they need to "unlock it" from the item into their wallet first.
            </p>

            <p>
                Tips work fine in the GUI app already, but there's something even more cool that
                you can do only from the command line at present. You can use some of your
                credits to support someone else's channel or item <i>without sending them a tip</i>,
                and in a way that can be easily reversed if you actually want to spend the LBC
                or use it elsewhere.
                A tip is a special case of something which is more generally called a "support" &mdash;
                specifically, a tip is a support where you lose the LBC you tip and the publisher gains it.
                The other kind of
                support lets you put some of your LBC towards someone else's publication, but you
                retain the right to withdraw it at any time, rather than giving that right
                to the publisher.
            </p>

            <p>
                To make one of these, first you need the unique identifier of the claim
                (channel or published file), called the claim_id. If you know the full
                URL already, the claim_id is just the part after the hash. If you only
                know the short URL, you can go to the command line and type something
                like this
            </p>
            <pre>lbrynet resolve lbry://hello</pre><br>

            <p>
                and then look for the claim_id in the output. If the item is
                inside a channel, you'll get the channel's claim_id in the
                output too, so make sure you can tell which is which.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once you know the claim_id, it's pretty easy to make a non-tip
                support. Here's how I would do it for the hello example once
                I knew the claim_id:
            </p>
            <pre>lbrynet support create --claim_id=b981513aeb8ff0394cc2d1d4aef6c1fa5177e24a --amount=10.0</pre><br>

            <p>
                If you wanted to create the support as a tip instead (like you
                can do in the app), just pass an extra --tip option to the
                command.
            </p>

            <p>
                Obviously the amount can be changed depending on how much you
                want to use. If you decide to abandon the support (i.e., withdraw
                the LBC back to yourself, you don't need to use the command line &mdash;
                the transaction appears in the app with a little trash icon next
                to it which you can use to abandon the support.
                Now that I know about this, there's little reason not to
                deposit most of my credits against stuff I like.
            </p>

            <p>
                The initial flurry of posts here may have implied that I would
                be keeping up that rate long term. I can't promise that, but I
                will try to post regularly still. Things have been pretty busy
                with teaching STATS 731 for the first time (I always find it
                hard to teach a course for the first time), and with Mackenzie
                picking up viruses from daycare on a regular basis.
            </p>

            <p>
                One thing I've done to 731 is to put in Nested Sampling and
                more on model comparison. I've been emphasising it a lot.
                If you're interested in that, you might enjoy

                "paradox", which includes a diagram explaining it.

               name="eighties-australiana">80s Australiana/Nostalgia</a>
            <p>2019-05-16</p>

            <p>
                When I lived in Australia, I never really paid much attention to
                the popular pop/rock singers that Australia had produced.
                I think I
                thought of them (Jimmy Barnes, John Farnham et al)
                as cheesy. But after
                living in the USA for three years I became really nostalgic
                for them, and this was boosted when I realised they were
                excellent singers. They also fit into the eras of music
                where most of my favourites are from &mdash; commonly known
                as "dad music". I don't know why, but
                I've always been a few decades
                behind, except for when I liked some 90s artists in the
                late 90s.
            </p>

            <p>
                My latest "discovery" along the same lines, who I've known about
                my whole life, is Iva Davies and Icehouse. I've been digging
                the album <a href="https://www.allmusic.com/album/man-of-colours-mw0000197386"
                target="_blank">Man of Colours</a>. It sounds a lot like 80s-era
                David Bowie (think "Let's Dance"), and I think they actually
                toured together around that time:
            </p>

                 alt="Bowie and Davies" width="40%">
            </p>

            <p>
                Davies's vocals are often in the tenor range which I always find
                exciting and challenging, and he provides more evidence that mullets
                assist with this. Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMQwRL0EzW0" target="_blank">"Crazy"</a>,
                which shows off the mullet and the harbour bridge. Iconic!

            <p>2019-05-09</p>

            <p>
                Answer: 36. That's 36 people who don't understand the LBRY
                naming/URL system, which works using <a href="https://lbry.com/faq/naming" target="_blank">a form of auction that
                provides no incentive to squatting.</a> [edit: found the
                easier explanation].
                That's also 36 people who are going to be disappointed
                if LBRY becomes popular and then find out their reward
                for early-adopting and calling their channel @PewDiePie is
                basically nothing.
            </p>

            <p>
                For technical people, the command I ran to get that
                was:
            </p>
            <pre>lbrynet claim list @pewdiepie | grep claim_id | wc -l</pre>

            <br>
            <p>
                There'll be an upgrade soon where the relevant command will
                change to:
            </p>
            <pre>lbrynet claim search @pewdiepie | grep claim_id | wc -l</pre>

            <p>2019-05-09</p>

            <p>
                A quote from statistician John Tukey that is a cliché for a
                reason
                is <i>the best thing about being a statistician is that you get
                to
                play in everyone's backyard</i>. Sometimes, other people invite
                you
                to their backyards,
                <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04556" target="_blank">like
                geophysicist Mike Rowe did</a>. Other times, you just invite
                yourself
                over.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <a href="http://completevocal.institute" target="_blank">Complete
                Vocal Institute</a> was founded by
                Cathrine Sadolin, who struggled to learn to sing
                until she reinvented the field in a way
                that made sense for herself. Singing teaching has historically
                been a lot more of an art than a science, and her approach is a lot
                more methodical than most. There are things you could critique
                about it of course, but when I discovered it years ago it grabbed
                my attention because it was the first time I'd seen someone
                actually write down an explicit model for the things voices can do
                and how to do each of those things. While the new me™️ is not
                a rationalist, singing instruction needed more of that on the margin.
                Actually connecting the model to practice was hard for me and it took
                a long time, and the model has been revised over the years anyway
                as they have been researching things and modifying it accordingly.
            </p>

            <p>
                Speaking of research, I just emailed them a few weeks ago to register
                myself as a fan of their work and a potential collaborator if they
                need statistics, which it turns out they do! So I'm now looking
                for a graduate student who's interested in vocals to work with me on
                that. They have lots of data and there are still forms to sign, but
                there should be lots of possibilities here! To be honest, there's some
                chance it won't work out, but I am excited so felt the need to
                write this and tell y'all about it.

            <p>2019-05-06</p>

            <p>
                One of the best and worst things about being an academic is
                that sometimes you are assigned to teach a course about
                something you aren't very good at, or in some cases, have
                never learned at all. As long as you can keep ahead of the
                students, it usually works out fine. I've been lucky so far
                that this hasn't happened much, and when it has, I've been
                grateful to have learned the new material.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the courses I've been teaching regularly for a few years
                is <a href="https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/ItDT/" target="_blank">STATS 220</a>,
                an introductory computing course for statistics students,
                which teaches a bit of HTML, file formats, XML, SQL, and R.
                The course is the brainchild of <a href="https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul" target="_blank">Paul
                Murrell</a>, but our previous
                head of department wanted someone else to teach it so that more
                than one person knows the course. I was happy to
                do it since I like computing, and saying yes meant I was less
                likely to ever have to teach frequentism.
                When I started I knew a bit of HTML and R, and knew about
                file formats, but had never touched XML or SQL. At first I
                learned enough in order to teach the course, but not much more.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, recently I've had occasion to actually use more of
                this stuff in actual projects. For instance, this blog is written
                in plain HTML, and STATS 220's little HTML/CSS section has
                helped a fair bit so that I understand what I'm looking at when
                I use HTML. Today I set up an RSS feed (see that little button at
                the top of this page), which is secretly just an XML file, which
                I hand-wrote based on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/XML/xml_rss.asp"
                target="_blank">this guide from W3Schools</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've also recently enjoyed using SQL to query the LBRY
                blockchain and plot things such as the <a href="https://spee.ch/@BrendonBrewer:8/cryptocandor-tip-history.pdf"
                target="_blank">amount various creators have received in tips</a>
                and the <a href="https://spee.ch/@BrendonBrewer:8/nine.svg" target="_blank">total
                number of publications over time</a>. Those were done using
                simple SELECT commands as taught in STATS 220 &mdash; the
                only slightly fancy stuff being (i) an INNER JOIN of a table
                with itself, and (ii) figuring out how to submit the darned
                query to their MySQL server and handle the results that come back.
            </p>

            <p>
                See, students, some of this stuff <i>is</i> useful!

            <p>
                I'm a bit unusual among Bayesians in that I still think the principle of maximum entropy
                is both true and (occasionally) useful, and that its critics have thrown out the
                baby with the bathwater. One of the chapters of my upcoming book,
                if I finish it, will be about this issue, and related ones such as where
                MaxEnt constraints come from in the first place.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some of the bad criticisms of MaxEnt focus on the fact that you can easily get
                poor predictions from a MaxEnt distribution,
                in an ex-post sense (i.e., a scoring rule could give
                the MaxEnt distribution a worse score than some other distribution that
                people might intuitively suggest). I don't know
                why this would surprise anybody. Any broad prior, especially on a
                high dimensional space,
                is usually bad in this sense. MaxEnt does <i>minimal updating</i>
                of probability distributions, and if you minimally update something
                that doesn't perform that well according to an ex-post criterion,
                you're likely to get something else that doesn't
                perform that well with respect to the same criterion.
            </p>

            <p>
                One interesting feature of MaxEnt distributions is that they often lead to
                macroscopically homogenous predictions. For example, let \(\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N\)
                be a batsman's
                next \(N\) scores in cricket, so the set of possibilities is
                \(S = \{0, 1, 2, 3, ...\}^N\). Starting with a flat prior over \(S\) and then
                doing MaxEnt with an expected value constraint like
            </p>

            <p>
                $$\left<\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N x_i\right> = \mu,$$
            </p>

            <p>
                gives a posterior distribution for the \(\{x_i\}\)
                which is a product of iid geometrics with means
                \(\mu\). If \(N\) is large, this implies a high posterior probability for the
                sequence of scores looking macroscopically homogeneous, because the
                constraint never put in any time-dependent information, and because
                <i>almost every element of \(S\) looks macroscopically homogenous</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, the actual sequence of scores \(\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N\)
                may have a trend or whatever. That doesn't mean MaxEnt is invalid!
                It still correctly updates the flat prior over \(S\) in a minimal
                fashion, which is what it claims to do.
                Most possible sequences (elements of \(S\))
                look macroscopically flat, so MaxEnt predicts that.
                Reality, being complicated,
                happened to produce a sequence that was atypical in that
                sense, but probably fairly typical in some other senses.

                This kind of thing makes my day:

            <p style="font-style: italic">
                Dear Prof. Brewer, <br><br>
                I work as a Data Science/ML professional in the US having done my grad study in Stats.<br>
                I came across your Bayesian Stats course you teach at University of Auckland. I must
                say I have never found such a cogent and coherent text on Bayesian
                Statistics ever.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now I'm in a good mood. In related news, I've moved the
                notes <a href="https://www.brendonbrewer.com/stats331" target="_blank">here</a>
                for online reading.

                for wide priors in JAGS/BUGS</a>
            <p>2019-04-30</p>
            <p>
                I'm currently preparing to teach STATS 731, the graduate
                Bayesian course here.
                My first lecture was meant to be today but
                I had to cancel it due to hoarseness following a throat
                infection. Anyway, the existing course materials use a lot
                of the traditional (in statistics) wide priors, stuff like this
                for a location and scale parameter respectively:

            </p>

                <pre>beta ~ dnorm(0, 1.0E-4)</pre>
                <pre>tau ~ dgamma(0.001, 0.001)</pre>
                <pre>var <- 1/tau</pre>
                <pre>sig <- sqrt(var)</pre>

            <br>

            <p>
                In the 1990s, it was important to choose conjugate priors
                to speed up the MCMC sampling, and in many cases (e.g.
                regression) stuff like this was appropriate. It still works
                today, too. However, in my experience students find the choice
                of a prior a bit mysterious, and these are more obscure than
                they need to be. Who has an intuition for what that gamma
                prior looks like &mdash; even for tau, let alone sig (the
                coordinate that's usually more interpretable). Also, are we
                really so sure beta is between -200 and 200? Probably depends
                on the units of the problem.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my lecture on Thursday I'm still going to use these priors
                but I'm also going to (a) plot them, and (b) compare them
                to uniform and log-uniform priors which they are fairly similar
                to over a decent range of their parameter spaces. Hopefully this
                will remove a bit of the shroud of mystery.

                I recently enjoyed

                   target="_blank">this excellent talk</a>
                by Dallas Willard, entitled <i>The Nature and

                Jonathan Haidt's work, it strikes familiar notes,
                but Willard's personal angle as a frustrated
                Christian in the secular university comes through.

                Regardless of what you think about issues of religion
                (I'm undecided myself), 90% of the talk can be filed under
                <i>important things I didn't learn until my 30s</i>, and can
                be applied to a great deal of other issues.

                When I moved my blog over here, I was a bit worried that I
                wouldn't be able
                to type \(\LaTeX\) anymore. But that's not the case! Thanks to
                <a href="https://mathjax.org"
                   target="_blank">MathJax</a>, I can now get equations
                in here
                very simply. Here are two of my favourites:
            </p>
            <p>
                $$P(H \,|\, D, M) = \frac{P(H \,|\, M)P(D \,|\, H, M)}
                                         {P(D \,|\, M)}$$
            </p>
            <p>
                $$H\left(\boldsymbol{p}; \boldsymbol{q}\right)
                    = -\sum_i p_i \log (p_i/q_i)$$
            </p>

            <p>
                While researching this, I also came across some PDF to HTML
                converters. That sounds like a horrible idea, but some worked
                a lot better than I thought. If you click on my CV at the
                top right you'll get what looks like a PDF document but is
                actually HTML! How cool.

                The other day I bought a domain name for my website, which
                was fun, and has motivated me to continue simplifying
                my internet
                life in a few ways. Over the last year or so I've successfully
                reduced my social media usage by about 80%, and am now using
                the internet like it's 1999 again (well, except for the

                <a href="https://keybase.io/">stuff</a>).
                It's been a pleasant experience, despite sounding
                a bit hipster.

                In addition, Wordpress has been annoying
                lately with too many promotional emails and generally being
                more complicated than I need.
                Therefore, I've decided that I'll no longer be posting
                at plausibilitytheory.wordpress.com. I'll leave it up so
                people can still read it if they want, but in general, any
                new posts will go straight to the blog page on
                brendonbrewer.com.
