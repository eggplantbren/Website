            <p>
                Hello everyone, and Happy Easter!
            </p>

            <p>
                Over the years, I've sometimes had to teach courses that weren't
                originally in my wheelhouse. Luckily, I've had good heads of
                department who haven't made me teach things I don't believe in.
                Sometimes, there's a little bit of that, but I can easily
                work around it with a sermon. It can be a bit of a challenge
                teaching material when your own understanding is only at the
                level of an A or A+ student in that very course.
            </p>

            <p>
                The benefit is that you learn new things. My previous
                best example was SQL, which I learned for STATS 220, and
                which I have been using a lot recently (I love
                SQLite, by the way!).
            </p>

            <p>
                Another is queueing theory, which is
                quite a nice subject with interesting and useful
                results about the lengths of queues. It becomes even better
                when you overlay your inner
                Ed Jaynes and understand that time averages and expectations
                are not the same thing, but that sometimes they equal each
                other. Basically, queueing theory is about probability
                distributions over what might happen in a plot like this:
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: center">

                <img src="https://brendonbrewer.com/lbrynomics/ytsync_new_pending.svg"
                     alt="YouTube Sync Queue Graph"
                     width="750">
                </a>
            </p>

            <p>
                As you can see, the number of people in the queue is
                constantly fluctuating as new people enter the system (usually at
                the back of the queue) and leave it (because they've been
                served). So there's no equilibrium in the sense of
                \(dy/dt = 0\). However, when only a probability distribution
                over \(y(t)\) has been specified, you can get equilibrium
                in a different sense, that \(p\left(y(t)\right)\) does not
                vary with \(t\). This is like in Markov Chain theory, where
                the thing that actually converges is the probability distribution
                for what the state will be,
                <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/08/10/markov-chains-dont-converge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not the state itself</a>. The same
                thing also shows up in statistical mechanics, where
                canonical distributions (for example) remain static even while
                particles obviously continue to move around.
            </p>

            <p>
                Time averages (e.g., the average length of the queue,
                \(\bar{y} = \frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^b y(t) dt\)) can
                also converge in the sense that, if you ask about a long time
                interval, the probability distribution over the value of
                the time average, \(p(\bar{y})\),
                can get really narrow.
            </p>

            <p>
                The other day, I was thinking about concepts of equilibrium,
                and how if the length of the queue is staying basically the
                same, then by definition the inflows and the outflows must
                be pretty much equal. I happened to be doing dishes at the time
                (which is traditionally one of my chores),
                and realised that the concepts actually applied to the dishes
                as well.
            </p>

            <p>
                If the pile of dishes in and around the sink is not growing
                or shrinking at a crazy rate, our household must be dirtying
                them at the same rate as I am cleaning them. That rate is
                higher lately since we've been stuck at home and cannot order
                takeaways. Anyway, this realisation gave me an epiphany:
                <em>apart from an initial transient where I need to work
                harder, it takes just as much work to maintain the dish pile
                near zero size as it does to maintain it at a large size</em>.
                In either case, if the dish pile is stable, my work rate
                equals the rate at which we are dirtying dishes.
            </p>


            <p>
                After I realised that, I immediately implemented the transient,
                and the kitchen has been better ever since.
                Now, please 
                excuse me as there are a couple of dishes in the sink that
                need doing.
            </p>
