            <p>2020-11-20</p>

            <p>
                It's been quite a productive and eventful week for me, and I
                wanted to share why. Here are a few things that happened:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    My former PhD student David Huijser got
                    <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02230" target="_blank"
                       rel="noopener noreferrer">our old paper
                    on the Affine Invariant Ensemble Sampler</a> (made famous by
                    the <em>emcee</em> software package) into shape and got it
                    accepted for publication.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Masters student <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannah-jamieson-68536a95/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hannah Jamieson</a>
                    submitted her dissertation
                    on Bayesian A/B Testing in industry. It was an interesting
                    project that started out very open-ended, but we ended up
                    learning quite a bit, including that you probably shouldn't
                    use independent uniform priors on Bernoulli parameters in
                    most real applications. It was also the first time I used
                    a Weibull distribution for something.
                </li>

                <li>
                    I discovered and fixed a couple of bugs in
                    <a href="https://github.com/eggplantbren/DNest5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNest5</a>. Luckily, nobody uses it except me, though
                    I hope that changes soon.
                </li>

                <li><s>
                    A little while ago some LBRY employees told me about a new
                    frontpage section they wanted for <a href="https://odysee.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Odysee</a>, and I suggested they
                    use <a href="https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-sdk/blob/master/lbry/wallet/server/db/trending/variable_decay.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one
                    of my trending algorithms</a> to do it.
                    They did so, and <em>Wild West</em> is now live on the site.
                    That's pretty exciting for me
                    as the number of Odysee users is growing rapidly.
                    Compared to the vanilla trending algorithm, Wild West
                    has additional filters to only show videos,
                    and only ones published in the last few days.</s>
                    Alas, they have replaced it with a different and simpler
                    choice. :)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                There's more too, but I'll save it for future posts. :-)

               name="hot-property">
                Hot Property!
            </a>
            <p>2020-10-06</p>

            <p>
                I've <a href="https://brendonbrewer.com/blog2019.html#pewdiepie-lbry"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blogged before</a>
                about the
                <a href="https://lbry.com/faq/naming" target="_blank">LBRY naming system,</a> which
                I think is very clever. With the introduction of reposts (like
                retweets on Twitter), I realised <a href="https://odysee.com/@BrendonBrewer:3/reposts-are-cool:1"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it is possible to obtain nice, easy
                URLs</a> to point to the existing content, like a shortcut.
                The other day I decided to get some good ones for some of
                my publications, so now I have the following:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://odysee.com/bayes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lbry://bayes</a> for the STATS 331 recorded lectures (it previously pointed to 3Blue1Brown!);</li>
                <li><a href="https://odysee.com/entropy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lbry://entropy</a> for my popular-level article about entropy; and</li>
                <li><a href="https://odysee.com/audiobooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lbry://audiobooks</a> for my project to scrape and re-publish public domain audiobooks to the LBRY network.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The links open on Odysee, the newest, best-looking,
                and least technical LBRY interface. Now hopefully I will
                retain these and the links above won't start redirecting
                somewhere else. If that happens I might increase my bids, at
                least to a certain point. I predict that some of these
                "vanity URLs" might become hot property!

                Three Determinants of Belief According to Tim Keller
            </a>
            <p>2020-10-05</p>

            <p>
                Recently I was talking to a friend about a hot topic which
                smart people disagree about strongly, and he noted that it was
                evidence for a pessimistic view of reason (e.g., as
                described by Jonathan Haidt's metaphor of the elephant and the
                rider). That's definitely true &mdash; if humans were so good
                at reasoning we'd be able to write Haskell programs without
                needing the compiler to tell us about errors &mdash; but it
                also reminded me of some recent wisdom I got from Tim Keller.
            </p>

            <p>
                Keller states that worldview-level beliefs (as opposed to
                trivial beliefs like that I just ate a slice of pizza),
                there are usually three ingredients required and present:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Some facts and reasoning</li>
                <li>Some influence of the local culture and things that
                    <em>everyone knows</em></li>
                <li>Some personal reason (e.g., you admire someone who believes
                    X, or some event happens in your life that points you
                    towards Y).
            </ol>

            <p>
                Keller believes it is a mistake to imply that one side of a
                debate is based on facts and logic and the other is not.
                This doesn't mean they are irrelevant or that these things
                don't matter &mdash; just that they are present to some extent
                on all sides and it is prideful to simply assume there's more
                on your side unless you have checked very carefully.
            </p>

            <p>
                Looking back on the several changes of worldview I've had over
                my life so far, this model is definitely consistent with my
                own experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                In <a href="https://lbry.tv/@BrendonBrewer:3/dfs:5"
                      target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNest4

            </p>

            <p class="quote">
                You might be wondering why the package is called DNest4 when
                the actual version number is (at the time of writing) 0.2.4. The
                reason is that it was the fourth time Iâ€™d implemented the
                algorithm from scratch. I doubt Iâ€™ll be doing it again.
            </p>

            <p>
                Oops, I did it again.
            </p>

                 width="300" alt="Ron Paul It's Happening"
                 style="padding-bottom: 1em;">

            <p>
                This came about because I gained some proficiency with SQLite,
                and realised that (a) it would be a better way of saving outputs
                than my old method of multiple text files, and (b) indexing
                would speed up many Nested Sampling operations, which by
                definition involve sorting. I tried for several months to come
                up with something that outperformed DNest4, but didn't succeed,
                so re-implemented the same algorithm with the SQLite database
                as output.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some improvements that I have already implemented are:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Configuration is via a single YAML file instead DNest4's
                    method of a mixture of a home-spun
                    plain text format with command line options;</li>
                <li>DNest4 saves particles infrequently to avoid taking up
                    too much disk space. In DNest5, this is true of
                    "full particles" including parameters, but metadata only
                    (log likelihoods etc) can be saved more frequently;</li>
                <li>A lot of the source code is cleaner, simply because I got
                    better at C++. DNest5 is written in a header-only style.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Some that are coming soon are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Model specification in a YAML file, so users can run
                    analyses without doing any programming at all;</li>
                <li>Ability to resume sampling from a run that has been
                    terminated;</li>
                <li>Ability to resume sampling in a targeted way, to clean up
                    areas of the run that were difficult;</li>
                <li>A more principled way of deleting lagging particles;</li>
                <li>Ways of merging separate runs;</li>
                <li>and more (TBA).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                When it's released in some form or another, I'll make another
                post here.

                A Little Thomas Sowell Excerpt

            <p>2020-06-07</p>   

            <p>
                I read Thomas Sowell's <em>Intellectuals and Society</em> a few
                years ago, and it has had a lasting impact on how I see the
                world. I've been thinking about it a lot recently, and thought
                I'd share an excerpt that keeps coming to mind. Ellipses
                indicate that I've cut out some of the text.
            </p>

            <p class="quote">
                To understand intellectuals' role in society, we must look
                beyond their rhetoric, or that of their critics, to the reality
                of their revealed preferences.

                How can we tell what anyone's goals and priorities are?
                One way might be to pay attention to what they say. But of

                since the goal of being on the side of the angels is
                accomplished when the policies have been advocated and then

                other issues. The revealed preference of many, if not most, of
                the intelligentsia has been to be on the side of the angels.

                John Ioannidis is one of the most important scientists of
                recent decades, being the lead author of

                (apologies to LBRYans for sharing

                Slightly tangentially, but not really, I also recommend

            <p>
                This semester I'm teaching the entire STATS 731 course, which
                is graduate Bayesian Inference. As you might expect, I'm having
                fun with it and putting in random curiosities and sermons to
                explain why I think certain things (some of which are unusual).
            </p>

            <p>
                At the beginning, I went over Kevin Knuth's work on
                Boolean lattices, even getting the students to draw a Hasse
                diagram in the first tutorial. I also covered conditioning
                in the full space of the problem &mdash; where the Bayesian
                update merely eliminates hypotheses from consideration. I'm
                hoping to implant some understanding into the students that I
                didn't get until years after my PhD.
            </p>

            <p>
                The students have been tolerating, and in some cases even
                enjoying, these aspects of the course. It's a good group,
                many of whom work hard and really want to throughly
                understand things, making teaching a pleasure. Anyway,
                the main reason I'm posting about this here is to link y'all

               or How Queueing Theory Could Change Your Life</a>
            <p>2020-04-10</p>

            <p>
                Hello everyone, and Happy Easter!
            </p>

            <p>
                Over the years, I've sometimes had to teach courses that weren't
                originally in my wheelhouse. Luckily, I've had good heads of
                department who haven't made me teach things I don't believe in.
                Sometimes, there's a little bit of that, but I can easily
                work around it with a sermon. It can be a bit of a challenge
                teaching material when your own understanding is only at the
                level of an A or A+ student in that very course.
            </p>

            <p>
                The benefit is that you learn new things. My previous
                best example was SQL, which I learned for STATS 220, and
                which I have been using a lot recently (I love
                SQLite, by the way!).
            </p>

            <p>
                Another is queueing theory, which is
                quite a nice subject with interesting and useful
                results about the lengths of queues. It becomes even better
                when you overlay your inner
                Ed Jaynes and understand that time averages and expectations
                are not the same thing, but that sometimes they equal each
                other. Basically, queueing theory is about probability
                distributions over what might happen in a plot like this
                (on mobile [or anywhere for that matter], click the image
                 to see the whole thing):
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: center">
                <a href="https://brendonbrewer.com/lbrynomics/ytsync_new_pending.svg">
                <img src="https://brendonbrewer.com/lbrynomics/ytsync_new_pending.svg"
                     alt="YouTube Sync Queue Graph"
                     width="750">
                </a>
            </p>

            <p>
                As you can see, the number of people in the queue is
                constantly fluctuating as new people enter the system (usually at
                the back of the queue) and leave it (because they've been
                served). So there's no equilibrium in the sense of
                \(dy/dt = 0\). However, when only a probability distribution
                over \(y(t)\) has been specified, you can get equilibrium
                in a different sense, that \(p\left(y(t)\right)\) does not
                vary with \(t\). This is like in Markov Chain theory, where
                the thing that actually converges is the probability distribution
                for what the state will be,
                <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/08/10/markov-chains-dont-converge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not the state itself</a>. The same
                thing also shows up in statistical mechanics, where
                canonical distributions (for example) remain static even while
                particles obviously continue to move around.
            </p>

            <p>
                Time averages (e.g., the average length of the queue,
                \(\bar{y} = \frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^b y(t) dt\)) can
                also converge in the sense that, if you ask about a long time
                interval, the probability distribution over the value of
                the time average, \(p(\bar{y})\),
                can get really narrow.
            </p>

            <p>
                The other day, I was thinking about concepts of equilibrium,
                and how if the length of the queue is staying basically the
                same, then by definition the inflows and the outflows must
                be pretty much equal. I happened to be doing dishes at the time
                (which is traditionally one of my chores),
                and realised that the concepts actually applied to the dishes
                as well.
            </p>

            <p>
                If the pile of dishes in and around the sink is not growing
                or shrinking at a crazy rate, our household must be dirtying
                them at the same rate as I am cleaning them. That rate is
                higher lately since we've been stuck at home and cannot order
                takeaways. Anyway, this realisation gave me an epiphany:
                <em>apart from an initial transient where I need to work
                harder, it takes just as much work to maintain the dish pile
                near zero size as it does to maintain it at a large size</em>.
                In either case, if the dish pile is stable, my work rate
                equals the rate at which we are dirtying dishes.
            </p>


            <p>
                After I realised that, I immediately implemented the transient,
                and the kitchen has been better ever since.
                Now, please 
                excuse me as there are a couple of dishes in the sink that
                need doing.
            </p>
