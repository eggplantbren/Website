            <p>2019-05-05</p>

            <p>
                I'm a bit unusual among Bayesians in that I still think the principle of maximum entropy
                is both true and (occasionally) useful, and that its critics have thrown out the
                baby with the bathwater. One of the chapters of my upcoming book,
                if I finish it, will be about this issue, and related ones such as where
                MaxEnt constraints come from in practice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the bad criticisms of MaxEnt focus on the fact that you can easily get
                bad predictions from it, in an ex-post sense (i.e., a scoring rule could give
                the MaxEnt distribution a worse score than some other distribution). I don't know
                why this would surprise anybody. Any broad prior, especially on a
                high dimensional space,
                is usually bad in this sense. MaxEnt produces minimal updates of these, so
                inherits this property.
            </p>

            <p>
                One interesting feature of MaxEnt distributions is that they often lead to
                macroscopically homogenous predictions. For example, let \(\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N\)
                be a batsman's
                next \(N\) scores in cricket, so the set of possibilities is
                \(S = \{0, 1, 2, 3, ...\}^N\). Starting with a flat prior over \(S\) and then
                doing MaxEnt with an expected value constraint like
            </p>

            <p>
                $$\left<\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N x_i\right> = \mu,$$
            </p>

            <p>
                makes the posterior distribution a product of iid geometrics with means
                \(\mu\). This implies a high posterior probability for the
                sequences of scores looking macroscopically homogeneous, because the
                constraints never put in any time-dependent information.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, the actual sequence of scores \(\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N\)
                may have a trend or whatever. That doesn't mean that MaxEnt is invalid.
                It still correctly updates the flat prior over \(S\) in a minimal
                fashion, which is what it claims to do.
                The issue is that almost all possible sequences (elements of \(S\))
                look macroscopically flat,
                and reality, being complicated,
                happened to produce a sequence that was atypical in that
                sense.

                Dear Prof. Brewer, <br><br>
                I work as a Data Science/ML professional in the US having done my grad study in Stats.<br>
                I came across your Bayesian Stats course you teach at University of Auckland. I must
                say I have never found such a cogent and coherent text on Bayesian
                Statistics ever.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now I'm in a good mood. In related news, I've moved the
                notes <a href="https://brendonbrewer.com/stats331" target="_blank">here</a>
                for online reading.

                for wide priors in JAGS/BUGS</a>
            <p>2019-04-30</p>
            <p>
                I'm currently preparing to teach STATS 731, the graduate
                Bayesian course here.
                My first lecture was meant to be today but
                I had to cancel it due to hoarseness following a throat
                infection. Anyway, the existing course materials use a lot
                of the traditional (in statistics) wide priors, stuff like this
                for a location and scale parameter respectively:

            </p>

                <pre>beta ~ dnorm(0, 1.0E-4)</pre>
                <pre>tau ~ dgamma(0.001, 0.001)</pre>
                <pre>var <- 1/tau</pre>
                <pre>sig <- sqrt(var)</pre>

            <br>

            <p>
                In the 1990s, it was important to choose conjugate priors
                to speed up the MCMC sampling, and in many cases (e.g.
                regression) stuff like this was appropriate. It still works
                today, too. However, in my experience students find the choice
                of a prior a bit mysterious, and these are more obscure than
                they need to be. Who has an intuition for what that gamma
                prior looks like &mdash; even for tau, let alone sig (the
                coordinate that's usually more interpretable). Also, are we
                really so sure beta is between -200 and 200? Probably depends
                on the units of the problem.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my lecture on Thursday I'm still going to use these priors
                but I'm also going to (a) plot them, and (b) compare them
                to uniform and log-uniform priors which they are fairly similar
                to over a decent range of their parameter spaces. Hopefully this
                will remove a bit of the shroud of mystery.

                I recently enjoyed

                   target="_blank">this excellent talk</a>
                by Dallas Willard, entitled <i>The Nature and
                Necessity of Worldviews</i>. If you're familiar with
                Jonathan Haidt's work, it strikes familiar notes,
                but Willard's personal angle as a frustrated
                Christian in the secular university comes through.
            </p>

            <p>
                Regardless of what you think about issues of religion
                (I'm undecided myself), 90% of the talk can be filed under
                <i>important things I didn't learn until my 30s</i>, and can
                be applied to a great deal of other issues.

                When I moved my blog over here, I was a bit worried that I
                wouldn't be able
                to type \(\LaTeX\) anymore. But that's not the case! Thanks to
                <a href="https://mathjax.org"
                   target="_blank">MathJax</a>, I can now get equations
                in here
                very simply. Here are two of my favourites:
            </p>
            <p>
                $$P(H \,|\, D, M) = \frac{P(H \,|\, M)P(D \,|\, H, M)}
                                         {P(D \,|\, M)}$$
            </p>
            <p>
                $$H\left(\boldsymbol{p}; \boldsymbol{q}\right)
                    = -\sum_i p_i \log (p_i/q_i)$$
            </p>

            <p>
                While researching this, I also came across some PDF to HTML
                converters. That sounds like a horrible idea, but some worked
                a lot better than I thought. If you click on my CV at the
                top right you'll get what looks like a PDF document but is
                actually HTML! How cool.

                The other day I bought a domain name for my website, which
                was fun, and has motivated me to continue simplifying
                my internet
                life in a few ways. Over the last year or so I've successfully
                reduced my social media usage by about 80%, and am now using
                the internet like it's 1999 again (well, except for the
                <a href="https://api.lbry.com/user/refer?r=59ua6kNvRAdcSJjiN5MrxuZdR463uMaa" target="_blank">crypto</a>
                <a href="https://keybase.io/">stuff</a>).
                It's been a pleasant experience, despite sounding
                a bit hipster.

                In addition, Wordpress has been annoying
                lately with too many promotional emails and generally being
                more complicated than I need.
                Therefore, I've decided that I'll no longer be posting
                at plausibilitytheory.wordpress.com. I'll leave it up so
                people can still read it if they want, but in general, any
                new posts will go straight to the blog page on
                brendonbrewer.com.
