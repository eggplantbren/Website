            <h4>Trying out maths here</h4>
            <p>2019-04-29</p>
            <p>
                When I moved my blog over here, I was a bit worried that I
                wouldn't be able
                to type LaTeX anymore. But that's not the case! Thanks to
                <a href="https://mathjax.org"
                   target="_blank">MathJax</a>, I can now get equations
                in here
                very simply. Here are two of my favourites:
            </p>
            <p>
                $$P(H \,|\, D, M) = \frac{P(H \,|\, M)P(D \,|\, H, M)}
                                         {P(D \,|\, M)}$$
            </p>
            <p>
                $$H\left(\boldsymbol{p}; \boldsymbol{q}\right)
                    = -\sum_i p_i \log (p_i/q_i)$$
            </p>

            <p>
                While researching this, I also came across some PDF to HTML
                converters. That sounds like a horrible idea, but some worked
                a lot better than I thought. If you click on my CV at the
                top right you'll get what looks like a PDF document but is
                actually HTML! How cool.

            <h4>Retiring the Plausibility Theory blog</h4>
            <p>2019-04-28</p>
            <p>
                The other day I bought a domain name for my website, which
                was fun, and has motivated me to continue simplifying
                my internet
                life in a few ways. Over the last year or so I've successfully
                reduced my social media usage by about 80%, and am now using
                the internet like it's 1999 again (well, except for the
                <a href="https://api.lbry.com/user/refer?r=59ua6kNvRAdcSJjiN5MrxuZdR463uMaa" target="_blank">crypto stuff</a>).
                It's been a pleasant experience, despite sounding
                a bit hipster.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition, Wordpress has been annoying
                lately with too many promotional emails and generally being
                more complicated than I need.
                Therefore, I've decided that I'll no longer be posting
                at plausibilitytheory.wordpress.com. I'll leave it up so
                people can still read it if they want, but in general, any
                new posts will go straight to the blog page on
                brendonbrewer.com.
